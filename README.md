# Gradient and Directional Derivative 

The point of this project is to code a application in Python that takes the coordinates of a point in R² (given by the user), the components of a vector (also given by the user) and calculates the directional derivative of the function f(x,y) = x³y - xy³ at this point.

```bash
if __name__ == "__main__":
    directional_derivative()
```

Coordinates x : 2

Coordinates y : 5

Vector u component x : 1

Vector u component y : 1

Directional Derivative Slope = -146.37
